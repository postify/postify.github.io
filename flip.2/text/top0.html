<h3>Flipping Ain't Easy</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you noticed that only a few articles on Flipboard.com's website and app actually flip? Most articles scroll vertically. Only premium content gets the full flipping treatment. I suspect the code that goes into converting a scrolling website into a flipping one is complex. So I wondered if I could make this very blog post "flippy" in the simplest, most plain-vanilla way, using only front-end web tools and no JQuery.</br>
