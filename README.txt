The root directory of this project is dedicated to the Google Drive Music App:

1.) index.html loads a barbones, utilitatian, proof-of-concept app that uses
Google's JavaScript client api (gapi.js) to read, store, and play music files
in the user's Google Drive.
2.) app.html loads a prettier app that suggests the directioin
for sa finished product. It can only read and play the files,
but cannot upload them.

The goal is to combine both functionalities, and more, to make a viable
Google Drive music app.
